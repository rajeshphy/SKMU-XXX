## Introduction to LASERs
- A laser is defined as an optical device that generates an intense beam of light with high coherence and narrow spectral bandwidth. This is achieved through the process of stimulated emission, where an external energy source excites atoms or molecules to a higher energy state. When these excited atoms or molecules return to a lower energy state, they emit photons in phase, leading to the amplification of light. The term "laser" stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, highlighting its fundamental mechanism of operation.

There are two main mechanisms involved in the operation of a laser:

1. Population Inversion: This is the process where the number of atoms or molecules in an excited state is greater than the number in the ground state. This condition is essential for stimulated emission to occur and for the laser to function effectively.

2. Stimulated Emission: This is the process where an incoming photon interacts with an excited atom or molecule, causing it to emit a second photon with the same energy, phase, and direction as the incoming photon. This leads to the amplification of light and the generation of a coherent laser beam.

Stimulated emission is the key process that distinguishes lasers from other light sources, such as incandescent bulbs or fluorescent lamps. It is different from **spontaneous emission**, where an atom or molecule emits a photon randomly and independently of external stimuli.

### Light-Atom Interaction Process
Three processes in which atoms interact with light are given in figure below:

### Population Inversion Process
We need to create a non-equilibrium situation where more atoms are in a higher-energy state than in a lower-energy state, known as a population inversion. In this situation, the rate of energy radiation by stimulated emission can exceed the rate of absorption, making the system act as a net source of radiation with photon energy E. We achieve population inversion by starting with atoms that have the appropriate excited states. 

The energy-level diagram for such an atom includes a ground state and three excited states of energies E1, E2, and E3 as given in figure-a:

A laser using a material with these energy levels is called a four-level laser. For laser action, the states with energies E1 and E3 must have short lifetimes of about 10⁻⁸ seconds, while the state with energy E2 must have a long lifetime of about 10⁻³ seconds. This long-lived metastable state can occur due to restrictions imposed by conservation of angular momentum that hinder photon emission. The metastable state is the one we aim to populate.

```
Metastable State: A state of an atom or molecule with a long lifetime due to restrictions on the allowed transitions to lower-energy states.

To produce a population inversion, we pump the material to excite the atoms from the ground state into the states of energies E1, E2, and E3 as given in figure-b. In a gas, this can be done by inserting two electrodes into the gas container. When a high voltage is applied to the electrodes, an electric discharge occurs, causing collisions between ionized atoms and electrons that excite the atoms to various energy states. Within about 10⁻⁸ seconds as shown in figure-c, the atoms excited to states E1 and E3 undergo spontaneous photon emission, leaving these states depopulated. Atoms accumulate in the metastable state with energy E2. Although the number of atoms in the metastable state is less than in the ground state, it is much greater than in the nearly unoccupied state of energy E1, resulting in a population inversion of state E2 relative to state E1. The levels E1 and E3 are essential: atoms undergoing spontaneous emission from the E3 level help populate the E2 level, and the presence of the E1 level enables the population inversion.
